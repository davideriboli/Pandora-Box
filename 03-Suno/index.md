### Lyrics

```txt
[Intro]  
(Softly now...)  
(Gently we sway...)  
(Still the echoes fade...)  
(As we recall...)  
(The light of yesterday...)  

[Verse 1]  
Underneath that London bridge, shadows intertwine,  
Whispers of a lover lost, like old smoke and wine.  
I watch a burning candle, melt away its grace,  
The flicker of memories dancing, in our once golden space.  

[Verse 2]  
You wore your heart like James Bond, a slick masquerade,  
Exuding charm, yet something deep, was slowly starting to fray.  
With every stolen glance, I felt the tides of change,  
But the flame that held us close now seems so far out of range.  

[Bridge]  
A hypnotic rhythm sighs, through the secret streets we roam,  
Where love was once a fortress built, it becomes a crumbling dome.  
And as those dreams dissolve like smoke, I hear the city's call,  
In this transformation, we must learn to let it fall.  

[Verse 3]  
So now I walk beneath the bridge, where the past plays its tune,  
A burning candle flickers low, beneath the silver moon.  
With every step, I shed the weight, of what we used to be,  
Must find a new reflection in the depths of you and me.  

[Outro]  
(Softly now...)  
(Gently we sway...)  
(Still the echoes fade...)  
(As we recall...)  
(The light of yesterday...)  
```
